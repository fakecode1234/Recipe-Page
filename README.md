### What I Learned

In this project, I learned how to use `:first-child` and `:last-child` pseudo-classes to style specific elements, such as tables, without displaying borders at the beginning and end.

```css
.recipe-nutr tr:first-child,
.recipe-nutr tr:last-child {
    border-bottom: none;
}
```
